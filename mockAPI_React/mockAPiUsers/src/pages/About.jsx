        <p>The Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters is a special institute founded and led by Professor Charles Xavier to train young mutants in controlling their powers and help foster a friendly human-mutant relationship.</p>
        <p>The X-Mansion is the inherited property of Charles Xavier (Professor X) and has been in the Xavier family for ten generations including two known mutants in the lineage, both becoming detached from the family. Little else is known about them or their mutations.</p>
